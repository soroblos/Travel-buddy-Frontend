# Travel Buddy 2.0

A rehash of a previous travelbuddy design built with react.js and the django framework

## Mock design 



### User story

// As a traveler I want to be able to view the top rated dining options for the places that I travel to as well as be able to log my travel checklist so that I donâ€™t forget anything going to a new location or coming back.

//As a local I want to be able to view the best dining options  by my fellow locals as well as give my own opinion on eatery recommendations 

// As a user I want to be to create a checklist of my own needs as well as use already curated checklist to make my life easier

### `Future Improvements`

//Connect an USA states api and create a states key within my model so that i can access different states and get data based on the state 

//Add a index page that just lists all the states possibly through pagination so that users can select whcih state they would like to select from initially 

//create an activites model that follow the food model but just uses best activites to do within each state

//create a Todo List so that users can add stuff from the food and activiites model to a todo list model as well as add their own stuff so that the can better recall what they want to do 

//Add Google maps api so that users can have acces to directions from the locations listed in the cards 

//If maps api doesnt pan out add a website key to the model so users can go to stores website to see the menu or have a direct link to the menu
